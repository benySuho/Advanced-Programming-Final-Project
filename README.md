# Advanced Programming Project

## Background
This project is part of an advanced programming course aimed at developing a deep understanding of essential software design patterns and architectures. The primary focus is on implementing a generic HTTP server capable of handling various types of HTTP requests, including GET and POST.

The core objective is to build a versatile system that can support a publisher/subscriber architecture for computational graph processing. In this setup, nodes in the graph represent different computational tasks that operate concurrently. Each nodeâ€™s output serves as the input for other nodes, enabling the execution of complex calculations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone (https://github.com/benySuho/Advanced-Programming-Final-Project)
    cd project_biu
    ```

2. **Compile the Project:**
    ```sh
    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/*.java
    ```

3. **Run the Main script:**
    ```sh
   java project_biu\Main.java
    ```
4. **Access the Application**
   Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/app/index.html to access the application interface.
   
## Project Structure
The project comprises the following main components:

- **Server**: Manages incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers.
- **Graph**: Extends `ArrayList<Node>` and includes methods for detecting cycles and constructing the graph from topics and agents.
- **Node**: Represents nodes within the graph, which can be either topics or agents.
- **HtmlGraphWriter**: Generates HTML representations of the computational graph.
- **Servlets**: Handle various requests such as publishing messages to topics, uploading configurations, and serving HTML files.

## Features
- **Dynamic Graph Visualization**: Displays a computational graph where topics are represented as rectangles and agents as circles, with arrows indicating graph direction.
- **Interactive Forms**: Allows users to input and submit data through web forms.
- **Real-Time Table Updates**: Displays current topic values in a dynamically updated table.

## Usage Example
**Basic Server Setup**
To run the HTTP server, you first need to instantiate the MyHTTPServer with a specified port number and the number of threads. After that, you can register different servlets to handle various types of HTTP requests. Here's a simple setup:

  ```sh
// Create an instance of MyHTTPServer with port 8080 and a thread pool of 20 threads
MyHTTPServer server = new MyHTTPServer(8080, 20);

// Register servlets to handle specific requests
server.addServlet("GET", "/calculate", new CalculateServlet()); // Handles GET requests to /calculate
server.addServlet("POST", "/calculator", new CalculatorServlet()); // Handles POST requests to /calculator

// Start the server
server.start();
 ```
